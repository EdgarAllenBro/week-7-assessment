unshift seems to be more efficient at the lower numbers in the array, but its increase is more exponetial, almost doubling from 10 to 100, 
then going up again by around 6 times from 100 to 1000, where as with push its lowest number is higher but went up at mush smaller intervals for each
increased number. The main difference between these two functions is where the new number is placed. unshift puts the number at the start of the array, 
where as push adds it at the end, its possible that with how the function interacts with the array, inserting the new number at the start is more
efficient at lower numbers, but as the number increases, it may take more time due to needing to 'shift' all the other numbers in the array.
